          Next.js gives me the power of server-side rendering and static site
          generation with a modern React framework. Itâ€™s perfect for fast,
          SEO-friendly websites. But for smaller projects, its complexity can
          sometimes feel like overkill.

          Django is a solid choice for building complex web applications
          quickly, thanks to its batteries-included philosophy. Its admin
          interface is a huge time-saver. However, for smaller or more flexible
          projects, it can feel rigid.

          Svelte offers a refreshing approach to web development with its
          compile-time optimizations, making web apps faster and more
          lightweight. However, it&apos;s still not as widely adopted, which can
          limit community support and ecosystem tools.

          with server-side applications. But, for more complex interactions, its
          simplicity can become a limitation.

              Powerful frameworks that simplify modern web development. Next.js
              excels at creating fast, server-rendered React applications, while
              Django provides a high-level Python framework for robust web apps
              with built-in security. Svelte streamlines user interface
              development by compiling components at build time, resulting in
              lightweight applications. htmx enhances HTML with interactivity,
              enabling rich, responsive experiences. Together, these tools
              create an efficient stack for scalable web applications.
